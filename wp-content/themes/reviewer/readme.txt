== Description ==

Reviewer is a traditional blog/magazine theme that displays post in a 4-columns grid. Great for websites with a lot of posts.
The Front Page provides the ability to highlight your main posts as well as feature up to 5 different post categories.


== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Recommended Plugins ==

The functionality of this theme can be extended by installing the following 2 (free) plugins:
1. Custom Post Type UI (http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/)
2. Meta Box (http://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/)
3. WP-PostViews (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-postviews/)

== Custom Post Type UI Plugin ==
After installing and activating this plugin, go to Dashboard > CPT UI > Add/Edit Taxonomies and add some custom taxonomies for your review posts.
In the demo we have the following custom taxonomies for POSTS: vintage, grape, origin, winery, writer, genre.
The first 4 custom taxonomies are used by our posts in the Wine Reviews category.
The last 2 custom taxonomies are used by our posts in the Book Reviews category.
These are just some examples of how you can organize your content. Feel free to experiment and create your own taxonomies.

== Meta Box Plugin ==
After installing and activating this plugin, on the Edit Post pages you will notice 3 new custom meta fields under the post content.
These fields are built into the theme: Product Rating, Product Price, Product Profile.
These fields are optional, nothing will happen if you don't fill them for one (or all) posts.

== WP-PostViews ==
After installing and activating this plugin, go to Dashboard > Settings > PostViews and set up the plugin's settings.
The theme will automatically display the amount of views a post got. This counter will be displayed only on archive pages: homepage, categories, search, etc.

= How to setup the front page like the demo site? =

The demo site URL: http://demo.ilovewp.com/reviewer/

When you first activate Reviewer, your homepage will display posts in a traditional blog format. If youâ€™d like to add the additional featured sections from the demo, you can do that by going to Appearance > Customize > Theme Options.

= Footer Area =

The footer area contains 4 widgetized columns of equal width.

== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==

	1. The main column width is 760.
	2. In full-width layout the content width is 1040.
	3. A widget in the main sidebar is 340.
	4. The featured image on the front page and on pages works best with images at least 285 wide.
	6. The footer widget columns are of equal width: 275.
